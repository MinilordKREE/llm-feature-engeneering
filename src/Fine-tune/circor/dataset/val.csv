1. Presence of a murmur in an infant male patient: Murmurs in infants are not uncommon, but further investigation is needed to determine the cause and significance of the murmur.

2. Audible location of the murmur at the AV: This suggests a potential issue with the heart valves in this patient. Comparing this finding with other similar patient profiles may help identify common patterns or abnormalities.

3. Systolic murmur characteristics: Early-systolic timing, decrescendo shape, and a grading of II/VI indicate a potential abnormality in the heart's function during the systolic phase. Comparing these characteristics with other patients of the same demographic may help identify any common trends or potential underlying conditions.

4. Lack of information regarding diastolic murmur characteristics: Diastolic murmurs are less common in infants and may suggest a more significant underlying cardiac issue.

5. Auscultation locations: The murmur is heard at all four valve areas (PV, TV, AV, MV), suggesting a more generalized cardiac abnormality rather than a specific valve-related issue. Comparing this distribution with other patient profiles may help identify any common patterns or abnormalities.

6. Possibility of comparing data with other campaigns: Gathering data during the CC2015 campaign allows for the possibility of comparing it with data from other campaigns, which could help identify any trends or changes in the prevalence or characteristics of murmurs in infants over time.
